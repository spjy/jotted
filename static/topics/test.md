# Brief

Calculus is the study of limits.

## Theory

A limit is a value or function that approaches some value.

### Syntax

$\displaystyle L = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$

### Verbal

L is the limit of f of x as x approches a.

## Computation

Evaluating a limit is merely plugging in the value $a$ and evaluating the function $f(x)$.

$\displaystyle L = \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} x^2 = 4$
